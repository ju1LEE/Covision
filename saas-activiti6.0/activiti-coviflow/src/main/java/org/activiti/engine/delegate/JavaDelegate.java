/**
 * Convenience class that should be used when a Java delegation in a BPMN 2.0 process is required (for example, to call custom business logic).
 * 
 * This class can be used for both service tasks and event listeners.
 * 
 * This class does not allow to influence the control flow. It follows the default BPMN 2.0 behavior of taking every outgoing sequence flow (which has a condition that evaluates to true if there is a
 * condition defined) If you are in need of influencing the flow in your process, use the class 'org.activiti.engine.impl.pvm.delegate.ActivityBehavior' instead.
